Recommended material if you´re interested in doing this exercises:
1. Arduino Uno / ESP-32 (you´ll have to modify pins in code).
2. Arduino IDE.
3. Protoboard (At least 170 pts).
4. Jumpers (male to male and male to female).
5. Power supply 5VDC (use 3.6VDC for infrared).
6. Sensors (Each one).
7. If you need a resistor for LED´s 150 ohms should work.
